# TransferLearning

#### Transfer Learning script that operates on an SSD MobileNet V1 and V2 model pre-trained on a COCO image dataset

It lets users perform a transfer learning process on its own dataset of images

The training process can be watched with the Tensorboard visualization tool

The newly trained model can be used with the ObjectToSpeech application to perform real-time detection
